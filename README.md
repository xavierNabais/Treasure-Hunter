# Treasure-Hunter
Unity Game - Treasure Hunter

"Treasure Hunter" was a personal project driven by my desire to learn game development and test my skills in this area.
Throughout the development process, I delved into the creative aspects, brainstorming the game's format and letting my imagination run wild.
Programming became my favorite part, as I thoroughly enjoyed bringing my ideas to life and seeing them evolve into a playable game.
This project not only represents a learning journey but also a personal test to see if game development was a good fit for me.

If you are interested, you can test the game running the file "Minijogo.exe".<br>
